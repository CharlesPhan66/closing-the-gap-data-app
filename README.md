# Studio Project Starter Code
Starter code for the Studio Project. This is a simple layout connected to a GitHub Classroom that serves as the basis for implementing the studio project. 

This example program provides:

* A Java class for the Index page (index.html).
* 6x Java classes for 6 pages. Additional pages can be added by adding additional classes.
* JDBCConnection Java class, that uses the CTG Database. This class contains one method to return all LGAs contained in the Database.
* Examples CSS (```common.css```) file in the resources directory.
* Example image (```logo.png```) file in the resources directory with where to locate any images you want on your website
* Starting database:
    * ```vtp.db``` - contains a starting database for you based on the example VtP ER Model.
* Optional helper program (``VTPProcessCSV.java``) that shows an example of how to load the SQLite database by using Java to read the CSV files and JDBC insert statements to update the VtP SQLite database.
* Optional helper SQL files (```vtp_create_tables.sql```) that creates two tables (```LGA``` and ```PopulationStatistics```) based on the example CTG ER Model.

Classes backing Web pages:
```bash
├── PageIndex.java                    - Homepage page for Level 1 Sub-task A

├── PageST2/3.java                - Sets of 4 Java files backing the 4 pages for 4 Level2/3 sub-tasks.
```

   * sqlite-jdbc

# Building & Running the code
There are two places code can be run from
1. The **main** web server program
2. the **optional** helper program to use JDBC to load your SQLite database from the CSVs using Java

## Running the Main web server
You can run the main webserver program similar to the project workshop activities
1. Open this project within VSCode
2. Allow VSCode to read the pom.xml file
 - Allow the popups to run and "say yes" to VSCode configuring the build
 - Allow VSCode to download the required Java libraries
3. To Build & Run
 - Open the ``src/main/java/app/App.java`` source file, and select "Run" from the pop-up above the main function
4. Go to: http://localhost:7001

## Running the Helper Program
The helper program in ``src/main/java/helper/VTPProcessCSV.java`` can be run separetly from the main webserver. This gives a demonstration of how you can use Java to read the provided CSV files and store the information in an SQLite database. This example transforms the data in the ``database/lga_indigenous_status_by_age_by_sex_census_2016.csv`` file to match the format of the ``PopulationStatistics`` entity as given in the example ER Model for Milestone 1 for the Voice to Parliament social challenge. That is, the code converts the columns of the CSV into rows that can be loaded into the SQLite database using ``INSERT`` statements.

You can run the optional helper program by
1. Open this ``src/main/java/helper/VTPProcessCSV.java`` source file
1. Select "Debug" from the pop-up above the main function (or "Debug Java" from the top-right dropdown)
1. Allow the program to run

You can modify this file as you wish, for other tables and CSVs. When modifying you may need to pay attention to:
* ``DATABASE`` field to change the database location
* ``CSV_FILE`` to change which CSV file is bring read
* ``categoty``, ``status``, and ``sex`` arrays which should match the setup of the CSV file being read
* ``INSERT`` statement construction to:
    * Change the table being used
    * Column data being stored


# DEV Container for GitHub Codespaces
The ```.devcontainer``` folder contains configuration files for GitHub Codespaces.
This ensures that when the GitHub classroom is cloned, the workspace is correctly configured for Java (V16) and with the required VSCode extensions.
This folder will not affect a *local* VSCode setup on a computer.
